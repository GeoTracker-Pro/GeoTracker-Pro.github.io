# Firebase Configuration
# 
# The application has default Firebase configuration built-in.
# You only need to set these environment variables if you want to use a different Firebase project.
# 
# To use your own Firebase project:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Replace the values below with your Firebase project configuration
# 3. Find these values in Firebase Console > Project Settings > General
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id

# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/GeoTracker

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Firebase Setup Required
# 
# If you're getting "auth/configuration-not-found" error:
# - This means Firebase Authentication is not enabled in your Firebase Console
# - See FIREBASE_SETUP.md for detailed setup instructions
